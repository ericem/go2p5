This repository contains my entries for the 2020 edition of the Cerner 2^5 programming competition. For this years competition I have chosen to learn the Go programming language while working on my submissions. Why Go you ask? Well for starters, Go has been proclaimed [the language of cloud infrastructure](https://hackernoon.com/go-has-indeed-become-the-language-of-cloud-infrastructure-rob-pike-q51a3wle), and I work a team supporting cloud infrastructure. It's a language that I have been wanting to learn and now seems like a great time to jump in. For this years competition, each entry will have a cloud and devops focus. Go can be a little verbose, but I hope that I can still make something useful within the constraints of the rules.



## The Rules
* Any Cerner associate in any role or office location can participate.  You just have to know or learn how to write code.
* Submissions must be on a public repository on github.com.
* Only 1 submission per day will count.
* Submissions must be 32 lines of code or less.  (Lines will be counted based on the terminal symbols for the language, not based on a number of characters per line.)
* Comments will not count as lines.  (This way you are encouraged to comment your code.) However, the code must be able to stand on its own without comments.
* Please include a comment in your code of "cerner_2^5_2020". This will assist in a live feed of code examples which are pulled from GitHub.
* The code must be syntactically correct.
* Pair or more programming is okay, but keep in mind, we award prizes based on submission or repository, not on team size.  You may have to share a prize should your team win.
* The competition runs September 14 â€“ October 16, 2020.  No submissions will be accepted after October 16th at Midnight.
* Winners will be announced 2 weeks after the close of the competition.
