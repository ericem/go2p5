# Cerner 2^5 Programming Competition

This repository contains my entries for the 2020 edition of the Cerner 2^5 programming competition. For this years competition I have chosen to learn the Go programming language while working on my submissions. Each entry will have a devops focus and hopefully produce something useful in the end.

## The Rules
Any Cerner associate in any role or office location can participate.  You just have to know or learn how to write code.
Submissions must be on a public repository on github.com.
Only 1 submission per day will count.
Submissions must be 32 lines of code or less.  (Lines will be counted based on the terminal symbols for the language, not based on a number of characters per line.)
Comments will not count as lines.  (This way you are encouraged to comment your code.) However, the code must be able to stand on its own without comments.
Please include a comment in your code of "cerner_2^5_2020". This will assist in a live feed of code examples which are pulled from GitHub.
The code must be syntactically correct.
Pair or more programming is okay, but keep in mind, we award prizes based on submission or repository, not on team size.  You may have to share a prize should your team win.
The competition runs September 14 â€“ October 16, 2020.  No submissions will be accepted after October 16th at Midnight.
Winners will be announced 2 weeks after the close of the competition.
